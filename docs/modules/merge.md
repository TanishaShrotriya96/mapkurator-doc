### Description
When you crop a high-resolution map image into smaller tiles, you can analyze each tile independently, which can make it easier to process the image as a whole. However, in order to get a complete understanding of the image, you may need to merge the results from each individual tile to get a map-level prediction.

### Commands

The inputs for this module are patch-level spotting results stored in `json` files, and outputs are map-level results in `geojson` format. The map-level results generated by the module can be visualized using various tools, such as QGIS (Quantum GIS). 

**Note**: 
* **GeoJSON** is a file format used for encoding geographic data in a way that is easy to read and interpret. It allows for the representation of different types of geometries, such as points, lines, and polygons, as well as associated properties or attributes.

* **QGIS** is a popular open-source geographic information system that allows users to view, edit, and analyze geographic data. With the GeoJSON output from the module, a user can easily import and display the predicted objects or features on a map within QGIS, allowing for further analysis and visualization.
